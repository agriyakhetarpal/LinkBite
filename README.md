# LinkBite 

LinkBite is a fast, minimalist URL shortener web app built for simplicity. It uses the secrets standard library for PRNG-based cryptographic tokens in Python (see [PEP 506](https://peps.python.org/pep-0506/) for more info).

LinkBite has a FastAPI + SQLite backend with SQLAlchemy ORM to connect the RESTful API endpoints to the database. This project also serves as a primer to FastAPI and its advanced functionalities.

## Features

- Create and manage your own shortened URLs
- Graceful forwarding: check if the URL exists
- Analytics: count the number of clicks on your URL
- Admin to deactivate shortened links (through a secret key to said links) 

# User setup

## Installation

It is recommended to install LinkBite within a Python [virtual environment](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/a-complete-guide-to-python-virtual-environments/). LinkBite has a minimal number of dependencies enlisted in **requirements.txt**. To install all of them, clone the repository and run

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Environment variables

LinkBite uses [`python-dotenv`](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) to build environment variables. To test your build, set your environment variables in a `.env` file in the install directory.

```
ENV_NAME="dev"
BASE_URL="http://127.0.0.1:8000"
DB_URL="sqlite:///./shortener.db"
```

## Web server

FastAPI leverages the ASGI standard to implement asynchronous event loops within a single process. For the web server; in the current directory, run

```
uvicorn shortener.main:app --reload
```

# API documentation

You can view all the API endpoints in FastAPI's autogenerated documentation at the base URL, i.e., https://127.0.0.1/8000/docs by default, or the alternative documentation at https://127.0.0.1/8000/redoc. The API methods have been defined in `shortener/main.py`.
